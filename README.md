# SentinelIQ - Fintech Risk & Security Intelligence Platform

**Advanced Event-Driven Risk Detection, Real-Time Fraud Prevention, and Comprehensive Security Monitoring for Financial Institutions**

---

## Overview

SentinelIQ is a modern, enterprise-grade backend system designed for financial technology (fintech) companies to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, security threats, and suspicious activities in real-time. Built with a microservices-first architecture, SentinelIQ combines rule-based risk scoring, behavioral analysis, machine learning readiness, and comprehensive audit logging to provide financial institutions with a complete security posture.

## The Problem It Solves

### 1. **Real-Time Fraud Detection**
Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily. Traditional batch-based fraud detection systems introduce delays—by the time fraud is detected, customers have already suffered losses and institutions face regulatory penalties and reputational damage.

### 2. **Complex Risk Assessment**
Modern financial crimes involve sophisticated techniques:
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Money laundering through structuring
- Account takeover via compromised credentials
- Geographic anomalies (impossible travel)
- Velocity-based attacks (rapid transactions from multiple locations)
- Sanctioned entity access

These require multi-dimensional analysis across real-time events, historical behavior, and regulatory compliance frameworks.

### 3. **Regulatory Compliance & Audit Requirements**
Financial institutions must maintain immutable audit logs, demonstrate compliance with OFAC/sanctions lists, implement KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, and satisfy PCI-DSS, GDPR, and other regulations. Manual or fragmented logging creates audit gaps and compliance risks.

### 4. **Alert Fatigue & Operational Burden**
Poorly tuned security systems generate false positives, overwhelming security teams and causing alert fatigue. This leads to genuine threats being missed while resources are wasted investigating noise.

### 5. **Lack of Centralized Intelligence**
Without a unified platform, risk signals are scattered across authentication systems, transaction databases, and security tools. This fragmentation prevents organizations from seeing the full picture of an attack or coordinating responses.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### **1. Event-Driven Risk Engine**
- **Real-time event processing** - Consumes authentication, transaction, and user behavior events from Redis streams
- **Multi-layered risk scoring**:
  - **Hard Rules**: Immediate blockers (sanctioned countries, credential stuffing)
  - **Velocity Checks**: Temporal anomalies (5+ login attempts in 1 minute)
  - **Behavioral Analysis**: Deviation from user baseline patterns
  - **Composite Scoring**: Combined risk assessment across multiple dimensions

### **2. Comprehensive Rule Framework**
- YAML-based configurable rules without code deployment
- Rule categories:
  - Compliance rules (OFAC, sanctions)
  - Fraud detection (account takeover, suspicious patterns)
  - Anomaly detection (geographic, velocity, behavioral)
  - Login security (brute force, credential stuffing)
- Easy rule updates without system restart

### **3. Immutable Audit & Compliance Logging**
- All events stored in MinIO object storage for regulatory compliance
- Structured JSON logging with request correlation IDs
- Audit trail for:
  - Authentication attempts
  - User actions
  - Risk decisions
  - System changes
- GDPR-ready with configurable retention policies

### **4. Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT-based authentication** with refresh tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with fine-grained permissions
- **Organization-scoped multi-tenancy** for SaaS deployments
- Email verification workflows
- Secure password reset mechanisms
- Login attempt tracking and brute-force protection

### **5. Real-Time Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus metrics** for performance monitoring
- **Structured logging** with Loki integration
- **Grafana dashboards** for visualization
- Request latency tracking and performance analytics
- Health checks and readiness probes

### **6. Security Hardening**
- **OWASP Security Headers** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Trusted Host Middleware** to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
- **Request logging middleware** for audit trails
- **User tracking** with device fingerprinting
- **Encrypted secrets management** via HashiCorp Vault
- **Redis Stream-based event persistence** for reliability

### **7. Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- Organization isolation
- Per-organization authentication and user management
- Scalable for SaaS deployments serving multiple financial institutions

## Use Cases

### **1. Digital Banking Platforms**
Detect compromised accounts in real-time before attackers can access customer funds. Prevent unauthorized access and money transfers through sophisticated multi-factor risk assessment.

### **2. Payment Processors**
Identify fraudulent transactions at authorization time. Reduce chargeback rates and protect merchant accounts from compromise. Comply with PCI-DSS requirements with immutable audit trails.

### **3. Cryptocurrency Exchanges**
Monitor for suspicious withdrawal patterns, sanctioned entity interactions, and rapid account changes. Prevent money laundering through behavioral anomaly detection.

### **4. Lending Platforms**
Detect synthetic identity fraud and account takeover during loan origination. Verify borrower legitimacy through multi-signal risk analysis.

### **5. Fintech Startups & Neobanks**
Compete with legacy institutions by offering faster, smarter fraud prevention. Reduce operational burden with automated risk decisions while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### **6. Enterprise Risk & Compliance Teams**
Gain unified visibility into fraud, security, and compliance events. Investigate incidents quickly with comprehensive audit trails. Generate compliance reports for regulators.
